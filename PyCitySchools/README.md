## Insights/analysis

(written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.)

(RERUN THE KERNEL FROM START IN AM BEFORE SUBMITTING)

1. Amount spent per student per the budget related to test scores:
	* Interesting that as the amount spent per student goes up, average test scores seem to go down

2. School size vs. test scores
	* Smaller schools tend to perform better academically.
	* Top 5 performing schools were 5 small charter schools
	* Bottom 5 are large district schools



Hard to see if there are trends between grade level + math/reading scores.
