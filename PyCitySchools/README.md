## Insights/analysis

1. Budget per student as it relates to test scores:
	* Interesting that as the amount spent per student goes up, average test scores seem to go down. It's hard to tell if this is actually statistically significant, though. This would benefit from further analysis using matplotlib or the scipy stats package. However, it can be hypothesized that District schools have a greater overhead/administrative cost per student, and with large student populations, it is still difficult to provide a more personalized education experience to students, which brings me to my next insight...

2. School size vs. test scores
	* Smaller/medium-sized schools tend to perform better academically. There doesn't seem to be too much of a difference between the performance of small (<1000 students) and medium (1000-2500) sized schools, but once you traverse the threshold into larger schools, we see a significant decline in average reading, math, and overall performance. 
	* Top 5 performing schools were 5 small charter schools; bottom 5 were large district schools. District schools are important because it is necessary to have educational facilities which serve a diverse population of students regardless of socioeconomic status. These observations tell us that we should dig deeper into the "why" behind lower test scores in larger schools. Is there a way to allocate resources differently throughout the district to give District schools smaller class sizes?



Hard to see if there are trends between grade level + math/reading scores.
